AutoHotkey.ahk should not change. Once at installation it has to be copied to Documents folder.
It's task is to run script %HOME%\AHK\MyRoot.ahk

AHK is not able to #include scripts located with environment variables like %HOME%, so AutoHotkey.ahk file plays bootstrapper role here to workaround this.
